# vWATCH64
## A debugger/real-time variable watch utility for QB64 programs.

_Discontinued._

As of v1.6, QB64 will inherit the debugging abilities of vWATCH64. You can consider this the beginning of vWatch 2.0, as the functionality will now be native to the IDE.

Thank you all for your support throughout the years since vWATCH64 was released.

Looking forward to keeping in touch with you guys in the next iteration of QB64.

Fellippe.
